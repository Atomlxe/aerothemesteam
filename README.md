# Microsoft Office 2007 Styled Theme

![Preview](./assets/preview/main-window.png)

Based on a mockup by MondySpartan: https://www.deviantart.com/mondyspartan/art/Steam-Office-2007-Styled-Mockup-1060261068

## Plugin

This theme (optionally) requires a [plugin](https://steambrew.app/plugin?id=dc691b7d877b) for the top bar and some other additional elements. The menu bar, links to a game's store page, community hub, etc. and some other things will not be accessible if not installed.

## Titlebar is missing

It's going to be available in a separate plugin in the future. It's not released yet because it doesn't start early enough to modify `window.open` before the main window appears (but works for everything else). The screenshot only includes it so I don't have to take another one.

## Accuracy

<img style="float: right" src="assets/preview/context-menu.png" /> The theme features (almost) 1:1 context menus, tooltips & scrollbars. Other controls coming soon in a future version.
