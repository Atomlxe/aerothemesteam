# Microsoft Office 2007 Styled Theme

![Preview](./assets/preview/main-window.png)

Based on a mockup by MondySpartan: https://www.deviantart.com/mondyspartan/art/Steam-Office-2007-Styled-Mockup-1060261068

## Plugin

This theme (optionally) requires a [plugin](https://steambrew.app/plugin?id=dc691b7d877b) for the top bar and some other additional elements. The menu bar, links to a game's store page, community hub, etc. and some other things will not be accessible if not installed.

## WIP

Maybe. The main concept is finished, but next on the list are controls, then settings to look like Office 2007 as well because of the left side tabs layout, since there are too many.

## Titlebar is missing

It's going to be available in a separate plugin in the future. It's not released yet because it doesn't start early enough to modify `window.open` before the main window appears (but works for everything else). The screenshot only includes it so I don't have to take another one.
