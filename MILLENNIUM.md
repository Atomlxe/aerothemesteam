# Plugin for the Microsoft Office 2007 Styled Theme

This plugin adds a top bar, game filter status, and some other additional buttons. The top bar also has the account dropdown menu functionality if you press on the profile tab.

It's independent from the theme it's intended for but themes have to style it in order to be usable.

## Localization

You can translate this plugin to your own language by translating [this file](./locales/english.json) and naming it `russian.json` in the same folder, for example.

Some languages do not have an obvious name:

| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Korean                  | koreana     |
