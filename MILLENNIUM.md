# Plugin for the Microsoft Office 2007 Styled Theme

This plugin adds a top bar, game filter status, and some other additional buttons. The top bar also has the account dropdown menu functionality if you press on the profile tab.

It's independent from the theme it's intended for but themes have to style it in order to be usable.
